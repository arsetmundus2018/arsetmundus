<h2>es muss sein</h2><br/>
<h3>Johanna Winder - Peterhouse</h3><br/>
<br/>
sun bites relentless<br/>
through the canopy –<br/>
air thick with mosquitoes<br/>
bears down on her, with the weight<br/>
of heavy dread –<br/>
humid despair<br/>
<br/>
rivulets of sticky sweat<br/>
run over her pounding scalp<br/>
down her forehead, stopping<br/>
on the precipice that is her eyebrow<br/>
before crashing down onto an eyelid<br/>
in a wave of blinding, salty tears<br/>
<br/>
when will this end?<br/>
my lungs –  are full<br/>
of water<br/>
<br/>
it will not end –<br/>
despite the advancing blindness<br/>
its asymptotic existence<br/>
results in a perpetual almost<br/>
<br/>
in the icy glow of a winter moon<br/>
it is difficult to imagine<br/>
being so acutely warm<br/>
yet the dull, throbbing pain<br/>
at the base of her skull<br/>
feels so familiar<br/>
<br/>
there is a spider in my head<br/>
crawled into my mouth while I slept<br/>
and now under the curve of my cranium –<br/>
it has come to rest<br/>
<br/>
a web of terror shrouds her –<br/>
shivering as the city sweats<br/>
its layers of ice and snow<br/>
to birth a swollen river<br/>
whose smooth underbelly<br/>
is tarnished with scattered<br/>
glacial fragments<br/>
<br/>
peel off<br/>
its broken grimy skin<br/>
scratch at healing flesh to <br/>
get to the root of the itch<br/>
scrape through skin and sinew to<br/>
get down to the bone<br/>
<br/>
if I could just<br/>
get down to the bone of it all<br/>
<br/>
feral night creatures<br/>
gnaw at the ghostly skeleton<br/>
feeding the earth with its<br/>
pervasive marrow<br/>
<br/>
it is eating away at me and I cannot<br/>
escape the jaws of the beast<br/>
<br/>
and as spring soaks the earth<br/>
she begins to unfurl her curlicue spine<br/>
and stretch her roots<br/>
like rays of that agonising sun –<br/>
she will run<br/>
deep into the undergrowth<br/>

<h2>Dandelion seeds floating out over Lyme Bay (and away)</h2><br/>
<h3>Tom Pryce - King’s College</h3><br/>
<br/>
A whirl of glistening dandelion seed,<br/>
Caught up on the spirit of a mirror that breathes:<br/>
Wonderment, an always-past moment,<br/>
Carried by the fleeting current;<br/>
<br/>
A spray of snowflakes floating in space where all things which pass pass slower,<br/>
Drifting serene on the amber of afternoon sun which will make each of them a flower,<br/>
In the echoing shadow of a fisherman’s line, cast from atop clay slopes of the Black Ven,<br/>
Floating across its primordial waters, trickling down melodies to rejoin the sea again.<br/>
<br/>
To the waves of rippling, sleeping rows, smoothed granites and striped chrome of Lyme,<br/>
A weaving Jurassic field ploughed anew, each day by immemorially turning tide,<br/>
The spindling toes of giant’s feet, at the expanse which will swallow, redeal each rock,<br/>
A gleaming silk sheet of gently rippling lilac, loosely drawn, twilight, glistening table cloth.<br/>
<br/>
The swept pebbles a Labyrinth estuary, narrowing to earthen streams before tumbling falls,<br/>
Tributaries that feed seas growing to where we saw a puff of brushstroke dandelion before,<br/>
Among tall reeds which weave around the ankles of greying sheep caught just for a moment,<br/>
In the great cycle of Renoir’s Return from the Field, holding us there in its silence.<br/>
<br/>
<h2> The Wait </h2><br/>
<h3>Misbah Khatana - Girton College</h3><br/>
<br/>
“Breaking a hip at 92 she won’t last too long,” Mansoor thought. He sipped the drink the airhostess handed him and tried to twist himself into as much comfort as his cramped airplane seat could provide. He had taken 10 days off from his job but wondered now if two weeks might have been more appropriate. There would be the funeral when his mother died, and a few days later, (nobody would think he’d wait out the full forty days generally considered proper) the feast. His mother had almost reached a hundred, people would expect him to have a grand meal and he didn’t want to disappoint. Yes, he mulled wishing he could have a cigarette, perhaps two weeks would have been better. It depended when she went. <br/>
<br/>
The flight there took almost a whole day and he dozed for most of the six hours of the drive from the airport to his village. He chose to sit in the back seat of the car his cousin had sent to get him, and the times when he was awake, he made conversation with the driver. Even in the air-conditioned closed vehicle he breathed the dust he had grown up in, and over the years living away, had grown to despise. <br/>
<br/>
The driver pointed out sights as if he were a tourist rather than a son returning home. Mansoor ignored him most of the time and took in the mountains, fields and dust as it blurred past. It was difficult to make out anything in the horizon because of the near blinding sun. No wind blew, hardly anything in front of them moved and the intense sun made everything look hazy. Behind them was another matter; the wheels of their SUV disturbed the dry dirt track they travelled over and caused a linear dust storm that wound behind them like a sooty, sandy snake. <br/>
<br/>
"What's that?" he asked suddenly. <br/>
<br/>
Not far from them part of a hamlet lay in ruins. Once white walls seemed to be blackened and parts of walls and roofs had fallen in on themselves. <br/>
<br/>
“Oh that was many months ago Saab,” the driver said, using the title servants generally used for people of higher rank, <br/>
<br/>
“Nobody lives there any more. The enemy came and threw some of their special bombs on it.” <br/>
<br/>
“I heard someone blew himself up.” <br/>
<br/>
“No, no, that was at the shrine, next to the Madrassa” The driver replied fiddling with the air-conditioning. “During the Urs, the Sufi saint’s death anniversary...that was before this blast, about 50 miles from here.” <br/>
<br/>
“Not too near home then.” He took out his iPhone to see if he could use it in his native country. “Suraya’s children go to a Mudrassa don’t they?” <br/>
<br/>
“Her son, Saab.” <br/>
<br/>
<h2>The numbness of (the) age</h2><br/>
<h3>Isabelle Burroughes - Homerton College</h3><br/>
<br/>
Pulsing in<br/>
and out<br/>
of life…<br/>
<br/>
like a sequence of flashing lights.<br/>
<br/>
Memory; the alluring edge of a bubble.<br/>
Asking me to pass through the kaleidoscope of pain, to remember<br/>
the antiquated past.<br/>
Roots, that’s what they say, don’t forget your roots.<br/>
But I feel like mine have all been pulled up, torn and devoured in the cannibalistic carnage that we call society.<br/>
<br/>
Consciousness hammering<br/>
against the confines of my fragile skull.<br/>
I am like a man wrapped in exhausted lightbulbs,<br/>
A man with a soul worn down like a razor dulled<br/>
by too many strokes of the flesh.<br/>
But I am a woman who’ll be recycled again tomorrow,<br/>
joining the muscles of those primordial fathers who have gone before us.<br/>
<br/>
If only we could repeat time like we can repeat a song, replaying our favourite verse<br/>
over and<br/>
over<br/>
and over<br/>
again.<br/>
If only time was easier to translate<br/>
and innocence not given an expiry date.<br/>
Time…<br/>
The tick, tock,<br/>
of the corporate clock?<br/>
Or simply the change of the wind?<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Zodiac</h2><br/>
<h3>Deepa Iyer - Gonville and Caius College</h3><br/>
<br/>
I wish I had broken into two equal halves <br/>
When he left me. Or at least, in countable parts, With all the internal organs intact. <br/>
I hear that liver can grow again Like heart, like new parts of brain, <br/>
When sense dawns. But with all the bladders and coils, <br/>
That divert memories from the raw <br/>
To digested and discarded, There is no second chance. Blowing up into smithereens Spurts the molten magma inside Into indecipherable landscape, art. <br/>
You are stuck with the new carapace. <br/>
What is worse is the little things You did not ask for, Like sympathy wings or a pity tail. <br/>

<h2>Divorce in 26 letters</h2><br/>
<h3>Caroline Banerjee - Sidney Sussex College</h3><br/>
<br/>
When the last train pulls away,<br/>
You take a free city map<br/>
And rip it neatly down the centre.<br/>
<br/>
I get first pick.<br/>
I choose the secret garden with the stream,<br/>
The coffee shop that has glow in the dark stars,<br/>
The chip shop which<br/>
sometimes runs out of fish (and chips).<br/>
<br/>
You choose the park with the sun dial,<br/>
The smiling guy who teaches guitar for a fiver,<br/>
The only hill that has enough gradient<br/>
For a plastic sledge.<br/>
We share the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I watch you gather the alphabet and<br/>
Slot the letters back into dictionary order,<br/>
‘U’ and ‘I’<br/>
Stare out at each other from border controlled pages.<br/>
<br/>
I sign on the dotted line,<br/>
something falls between.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>the syntax of things</h2><br/>
<h3>Sarah Davis - St Edmund’s College</h3><br/>
<br/>
the months pass and you wait for the flowers to bloom,<br/>
as always.<br/>
yesterday you pulled yourself to pieces and glued each fragment back together,<br/>
one by one,<br/>
pressing them together until you were whole again.<br/>
each part is a tiny bit off centre,<br/>
so that when you step back<br/>
everything is wholly intact but wholly new.<br/>
this is what you were built from.<br/>
<br/>
here is the room with the locked doors,<br/>
the candles lit up and dripping their wax onto the hard-wood floor.<br/>
the musty air and the feeling of being fourteen<br/>
and curling yourself further into your seat<br/>
as if you could carve away a place to hide<br/>
until you’re ready for it all.<br/>
<br/>
here is the room with the red curtains,<br/>
the cotton bedsheets and the crumbs scattered over the floor.<br/>
the cloying heat falling through the window,<br/>
your body sticky with sweat and hope.<br/>
<br/>
here is the room where you fall in love.<br/>
here is the other one.<br/>
stack them up,<br/>
line them up like books,<br/>
order them by letter, by colour, by taste and memory.<br/>
<br/>
the snow falls and covers everything in hushed tones.<br/>
it melts and spells out your deepest secrets on your eyelashes.<br/>
<br/>
here is the last room:<br/>
it is filled with orchids and it tastes like the ocean.<br/>
<br/>
open your hands.<br/>
this is what you are left with.<br/>
this is the sculpture of disintegration.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Visita al Doctor</h2><br/>
<h3>Luisfer Rivera - St Edmund’s College</h3><br/>
<br/>
Si cruzando una mirada a los ojos con la persona, siente una vibración energética que inicia en la base del cráneo y se desliza por toda la espalda, provocando el enfriamiento súbito del raquis, y, al mismo tiempo, experimenta un brusco incremento de la temperatura en el resto del ser, entonces es amor lo que tiene.<br/>
<br/>
Si, por el contrario, lo que se manifiesta es una ininterrumpida desconexión entre el circuito sanguíneo y los pulmones, como la conmoción respiratoria que se tiene previo al pánico, entonces se trata de una ilusión.<br/>
<br/>
Antes de que me responda, en mi opinión profesional, ambas pueden ser letales, siendo la segunda mucho más peligrosa por sus efectos en el corto plazo, que incluirán una disminución de las capacidades cognitivas cuando se encuentre expuesto al factor contaminante, o la persona. Esto suele tener consecuencias irreversibles.<br/>
<br/>
La ilusión se caracteriza por la creación continua de escenarios platónicos e ideales, en donde la persona hace y dice exactamente lo que la mente del sujeto requiere para reiniciar el proceso cerebral de gratificación y expectativa.<br/>
<br/>
En casos severos, pueden presentarse alucinaciones, provocadas por la cada vez mayor necesidad de dopamina y que, afectará irreparablemente nuestra percepción de lo que es real.<br/>
<br/>
Esta realidad, la verdadera realidad, es usualmente burlada con una confirmación de lo no real mediante conversaciones con personas cercanas, que no pueden evaluar la veracidad de las afirmaciones del paciente.<br/>

<h2>Grief, in translation</h2><br/>
<h3>Ralie Belcheva - Trinity College</h3><br/>
<br/>
(transcript of a therapy session)<br/>
I wish I had the words to tell you<br/>
about the types of candles<br/>
in our church.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had the grammar to describe<br/>
the different ways to handle<br/>
covered mirrors.<br/>
<br/>
But I cannot make it clearer<br/>
than a litany of metaphors<br/>
for loss - which get lost in translation;<br/>
an entire nation’s worth of grief<br/>
that I cannot describe.<br/>
My textbooks never taught me<br/>
how to grieve in English too<br/>
and it’s been easy to forget the loving memories<br/>
and to distinguish between the sadness and the work<br/>
when sadness lurks outside<br/>
the borders of your spoken language.<br/>
And yet I cannot sentence it<br/>
to languish, inside a pile of sentences,<br/>
untouched -<br/>
but talking is too much<br/>
and I have no strength to add footnotes.<br/>
<br/>
<h2> the love letter is an epitaph</h2><br/>
<h3>Zooey Ziller - Wolfson College</h3><br/>
<br/>
she walked amongst the sombreness<br/>
of the winter branches, doubled<br/>
hauntingly in the water, dissolved and<br/>
immaterial, and rendered as they were,<br/>
unreal.  upon its undulating surface, the object trembles<br/>
and dissolves in the depths of her memory.  it was<br/>
structural, there was a diffusion; in despair,<br/>
she was engulfed.  now, she thought,<br/>
here the past is dictating to you.<br/>
<br/>
the space experienced transcends its<br/>
geometrical reality; it becomes a great image of intimacy<br/>
lost.  it consumes itself, it perpetuates itself, nobody<br/>
inhabits it, yet a consciousness it situated inside the walls.<br/>
reminiscence, rather than being a phenomenology of the mind,<br/>
is a phenomenology of the soul, a process permanently <br/>
involved<br/>
<br/>
in resurrecting that which is dying, to return like<br/>
a ghost, those retrievals, whose untidy gestures coalesce and<br/>
echo throughout the past.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
to walk was an experience of tiny deportations and<br/>
displacements.  like Orpheus, whose steps syncopated with <br/>
the temporality<br/>
<br/>
of grief, she sought an arresting rapprochement of the past.<br/>
sustained, carried in a state of eternal suspension, it<br/>
posits you, caresses you, with its gesture that is endless, <br/>
inhabiting you like<br/>
<br/>
a memory; it does not fill, but allows something vacant to <br/>
settle<br/>
<br/>
within, an inconsolable longing to be suffered and endured.<br/>
disembodied, disconsolate, the image of the beloved <br/>
speaks, enmeshing <br/>
<br/>
itself in the tonality, the cadence,    <br/>
of the past.<br/>

<br/>
Circular motion, or rather the shape of one’s iris,<br/>
or rather the way a still photograph moves, or rather still<br/>
the way a force will act on all matter in equal distance,<br/>
or perhaps not a horse cut in half, or even the recycled words of<br/>
the much needed reassurance that a public is forming<br/>
around an apparatus … There is a conditional nature <br/>
in what one sees, the partiality extended beyond <br/>
the protasis and the apodosis. Squint your eyes, <br/>
and you will change the image in front of them,<br/>
as if the muscle balance can affect the movement of <br/>
the world withdrawn. A lesson on names,<br/>
or speed of pronunciation. Ultimately, <br/>
a matter of memory, but before the silence of legacy,<br/>
an adventure that precedes the flight unseen.<br/>
Of course the contingency will spill over if uncontained,<br/>
one might begin with “Ead” or “Bellicorum instrumentorum <br/>
liber, cum figuris et fictitys litorisconscriptus”. Yet there is<br/>
a certain pleasure in animating a wild beast which was rendered<br/>
to a size of a salamander. <br/>
A primordial screen, almost, <br/>
where the sign has not yet fully<br/>
addressed its indexical nature, its temporal promise to deliver<br/>
movement from the centre of the surface. And in that centre<br/>
lies a point and an x.<br/>

<h2>Remains of/on the Beach</h2><br/>
<h3>Evelyne Scarborough - Newnham College</h3><br/>
<br/>
 A beach walk down memory lane <br/>
re-collecting shells, souvenirs <br/>
washed up from nicer places, better times.<br/>
One grey fits all from a far, disperses into<br/>
harlequin watercolour upon due attention.<br/>
Immobile indifference at first touch, thaws into<br/>
ardent acquaintance when eagerly embraced.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, intrepid pearl fishers, unfazed by <br/>
deep dark waters, bring back prized bygones.<br/>
Every now and then, I hold a shell to my ear,<br/>
my back to the ocean and listen to what I don't want to see:<br/>
waters left unexplored, precious trophies never claimed.<br/>
La Regrettee, sentenced to self-castigation by salty sting for<br/>
remaining safely on the beach, then and now.<br/>
<br/>

You say<br/>
We must get a portrait<br/>
<br/>
But there is one already <br/>
In my mind<br/>
A flashing kind<br/>
Those flashing eyes<br/>
That flashing red<br/>
Frozen<br/>
<br/>
And then the stage was set<br/>
Our audience <br/>
Empty stadium<br/>
Our witnesses <br/>
Ready<br/>
<br/>
Queens for a second<br/>
Broke free<br/>
Ran, spin<br/>
Unfrozen<br/>
<br/>
Flashing red<br/>
In motion<br/>
<br/>
Moment <br/>
forever frozen<br/>
In the lens-eye<br/>
<br/>
But forever treasured in my imagination.<br/>
Run, spin<br/>
<br/>
Dance<br/>
<br/>
Armoured together<br/>
Frolicking down the streets<br/>
So confident <br/>
we<br/>
So careless<br/>
So free<br/>
<br/>
Discovery I said<br/>
Where you said<br/>
Let’s go we said<br/>
<br/>
In that old street<br/>
New plans unfolded<br/>
We schemers <br/>
We two planted<br/>
<br/>
We sowed<br/>
We reaped<br/>
From the fantasies of Old Street<br/>
<br/>
Which bloomed beyond expectation<br/>
<br/>
That last day<br/>
Awkward as hell<br/>
But at least we weren’t left to dwell<br/>
<br/>
Searching for you in the humdrum crowd <br/>
Style<br/>
Lighting up that monochrome<br/>
<br/>
Colouring my world<br/>

each letter is like a seed <br/>
carefully woven into the fabric <br/>
of the heavy wet words of the earth <br/>
saturated by thoughts like water <br/>
arranged by the spades of memory <br/>
returning to the roots of the rhythm <br/>

traces of observations <br/>
